# NBA Shot Visualization Project

This project provides an interactive visualization of NBA shot data from the 2022-2023 season using Python, Pandas, and Plotly. It allows users to explore various shot types across different players, focusing on shot efficiency (Field Goal Percentage, FG%) and attempts (Field Goals Attempted per Game, FGA/G). The visualization includes dynamic scatter plots and integrates player images directly on the graph, offering a unique and engaging way to analyze NBA shot dynamics.

## Features

- **Interactive Scatter Plots**: Visualize shot data for NBA players, including FG% and FGA/G, with the ability to filter by shot type.
- **Player Images**: Player faces are plotted on the graph, providing a visual context to the data.
- **Customizable Visualization**: Users can toggle the visibility of player images and filter the data based on shot types through interactive Plotly buttons.
- **Comprehensive Shot Type Analysis**: Includes a variety of shot types such as Alley Oop, Dunk, Three-Point Shot, etc., allowing for detailed analysis.
